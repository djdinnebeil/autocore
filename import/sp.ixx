\brief Integrates Spotify functionality within Auto Core, providing music player automation and control.

This module facilitates the integration of Spotify features into the Auto Core application. It provides functions to control Spotify playback, retrieve and display the user's Spotify queue, and manage various playback settings. The module also handles starting the Spotify component, sending commands to it via named pipes, and updating the logger.

The main functions include:
- Starting the Spotify component executable.
- Sending commands to control Spotify playback (play/pause, next song, previous song).
- Retrieving and displaying the user's Spotify queue and currently playing songs.
- Switching playback between devices and downloading album covers.
- Sending an end signal to gracefully terminate the Spotify component.
